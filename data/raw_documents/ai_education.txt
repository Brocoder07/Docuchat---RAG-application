Artificial Intelligence Basics

What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.
The core principle of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Machine Learning Explained
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
It works by using algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Deep Learning Definition
Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (called deep neural networks).
These networks are inspired by the human brain and can learn from vast amounts of data. Deep learning excels at tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Neural Networks Purpose
Neural networks are computational models composed of interconnected nodes that process information.
They consist of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers.
Each connection has weights that are adjusted during training.
Neural networks are used for pattern recognition, classification, and prediction tasks.

Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Key applications include chatbots, translation services, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.
